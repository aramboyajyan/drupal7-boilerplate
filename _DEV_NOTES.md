This file should be included only in the main module of a project, and contain
the list of applied core patches, module patches and any other specifics of the
installation that is important for developers.

This information should be available in other places as well and the whole site
should be under versioning control. However, having the list of all patches,
specifics of the installation and other important details for the developers in
one place will lower the amount of time they need to spend to understand the
project.
